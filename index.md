## Welcome to Adrienne Hoarfrost's website!

I am a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Ames Research Center, developing deep learning and machine learning approaches to understanding complex biological systems and their interactions with the environment. I apply these techniques to problems in oceanography, carbon cycling and biogeochemistry, and space biology - to enable our understanding of life on Earth, in space, and in our search for life on other planets. 

### Featured Projects

- LookingGlass is a deep learning model encoding a "universal language of life" broadly useful for transfer learning applications in biology; [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.424215v2), [pretrained models](https://github.com/ahoarfrost/lookingglass), and [fastBio python package](https://github.com/ahoarfrost/fastBio) for doing deep learning with biological sequences are available.
- [MetaSeek](https://www.metaseek.cloud/) is a platform for searching, filtering, and curating biological sequencing datasets for your meta-analyses, enhanced by machine learning to constrain poorly constrained metadata.
- [CRISP](https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/astronaut-health/crisp/-/tree/CRISPv1_FDL2020) is a platform for identifyng causal drivers from high-D, low-N, heterogeneous biological datasets.
